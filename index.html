                Bangladesh's tourist attractions include historical monuments, resorts, beaches, picnic spots, forests and tribal
                people, wildlife of various species. Activities for tourists include angling, water skiing, river cruising, hiking,
                rowing, yachting, and sea bathing.
                
                In the northern part, comprising the Rajshahi division, there are archaeological sites, including the temple city Puthia
                in Rajshahi; the largest and most ancient archaeological site, Mahasthangarh in Bogra; the single largest Buddhist
                monastery, Paharpur in Naogaon; the most ornamental terracota Hindu temple, Kantaji Temple, and many rajbaris or palaces
                of old zamindars.
                
                In the south-eastern part, which is the Chittagong Division, there are natural and hilly areas like Chittagong Hill
                Tracts, along with sandy sea beaches. The most notable beach, in Cox's Bazar, is a contender for the title of longest
                unbroken sandy sea beach in the world.
                Cox's Bazar is the longest natural unbroken sea beach in the world.
                
                In the south-western part, mainly the Khulna Division, there is the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest of the world
                with royal Bengal tiger and spotted deer. The historically and architecturally important sixty domed mosque in Bagerhat
                is a notable site. In the north-eastern part, Sylhet division, there is a green carpet of tea plants on small hillocks.
                Natural reserved forests are great attractions. Migratory birds in winter, particularly in the haor areas, are also very
                attractive in this area.
                
                Ministry of Tourism and The Civil Aviation Ministry designs national policies for the development and promotion of
                tourism. The Ministry also maintains the Beautiful Bangladesh campaign. Bangladesh Government has formed Tourist Police
                unit to better protect local and foreign tourists as well as look after the nature and wildlife in the tourist spots.

                Bangladesh is situated in the north-east part of South Asia which is blessed with natural beauty, ranging from
                mountains, rivers, beaches, biodiversity, ancient archaeological sites, medieval monasteries to temples, pagodas,
                mosques, churches and many more. The majestic Himalayas locate some distance to the north, while in the south lays the
                Bay of Bengal. This big delta is marked by lush greenery and many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna
                rivers create fertile plains and the monsoon brings the necessary rain to soothe the hot summer making a charming
                weather round the year. Bangladesh has been ranked seventh out of ‘top ten best value’ travel destinations for 2019
                launched by Lonely Planet, a global leader of travel guidebook publisher. But in true sense, the whole Bangladesh is a
                classic hotspot of eco-tourism with diverse beauty and natural wonders.

                Bangladesh is full of natural beauty. Rivers, coasts and beaches, archaeological sites, religious places, hills,
                forests, waterfalls, tea gardens surround it. The Sundarban, Historic Mosque in city of Bagerhat, Ruins of the Buddihist
                Vihara at Paharpur are the three world heritage sites in Bangladesh among 1007. To observe the beauty of nature, huge
                amount of domestic and foreign tourists visit the country and its tourist attraction sites. In 2012, around six-lakh (6
                hundred thousand) tourists came Bangladesh to visit and enjoy its beauty. The total contribution of tourism to GDP was
                4.4%, 3.8% to employment and 1.5% to investment in 2013. Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation (BPC) looks after the tourism
                sector in Bangladesh under the ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism. Due to some limitations, Bangladesh has failed to
                introduce itself as a tourist destination country. The paper tries to focus on the attractive tourist spots of
                Bangladesh and the contribution of tourism in the Bangladesh economy. The major concern of the writer is to highlight
                the factors by which Bangladesh can be one of the major tourist attractive country in the world in near future.
